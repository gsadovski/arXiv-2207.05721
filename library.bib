  ABSTRACT = {A review of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity is presented. It is emphasized that general relativity may be formulated in terms of the tetrad fields and of the torsion tensor, and that this geometrical formulation leads to alternative insights into the theory. The equivalence with the standard formulation in terms of the metric and curvature tensors takes place at the level of field equations. The review starts with a brief account of the history of teleparallel theories of gravity. Then the ordinary interpretation of the tetrad fields as reference frames adapted to arbitrary observers in space-time is discussed, and the tensor of inertial accelerations on frames is obtained. It is shown that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian field equations allow to define the energy, momentum and angular momentum of the gravitational field, as surface integrals of the field quantities. In the phase space of the theory, these quantities satisfy the algebra of the Poincar{ \' { e}} group.},

  ABSTRACT = {General relativity can be presented in terms of other geometries besides Riemannian. In particular, teleparallel geometry ({\textit{ i.e.} }, curvature vanishes) has some advantages, especially concerning energy-momentum localization and its \mkbibquote{ translational gauge theory} nature. The standard version is metric compatible, with torsion representing the gravitational \mkbibquote {force}. However there are many other possibilities. Here we focus on an interesting alternate extreme: curvature and torsion vanish but the nonmetricity {$\nabla g$} does not --- it carries the \mkbibquote{gravitational force}. This {\textit{symmetric teleparallel}} representation of general relativity covariantizes (and hence legitimizes) the usual coordinate calculations. The associated energy-momentum density is essentially the Einstein pseudotensor, but in this novel geometric representation it is a true tensor.},

  ABSTRACT = {The field equations of general relativity with spin and torsion (U4 theory) are considered to describe correctly the gravitational properties of matter on a microphysical level. By an averaging procedure one arrives at a macroscopic field equation, which under normal matter densities coincides with Einstein{'}s equation of conventional general relativity. For very high matter densities, even if the spin are randomly distributed, Einstein{'}s equation breaks down and U4 theory must be applied. It is shown how the singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking must be modified to apply in U4 theory. All known cosmological models in U4 theory which prevent singularities are shown to violate an energy condition of a singularity theorem.},

  ABSTRACT = {A generalization of Einstein{'}s gravitational theory is discussed in which the spin of matter as well as its mass plays a dynamical role. The spin of matter couples to a non-Riemannian structure in space-time, Cartan{ '}s torsion tensor. The theory which emerges from taking this coupling into account, the U4 theory of gravitation, predicts, in addition to the usual infinite-range gravitational interaction medicated by the metric field, a new, very weak, spin contact interaction of gravitational origin. We summarize here all the available theoretical evidence that argues for admitting spin and torsion into a relativistic gravitational theory. Not least among this evidence is the demonstration that the U4 theory arises as a local gauge theory for the Poincaré group in space-time. The deviations of the U4 theory from standard general relativity are estimated, and the prospects for further theoretical development are assessed.},

  ABSTRACT = {General Relativity assumes that spacetime is fully described by the metric alone. An alternative is the so called Palatini formalism where the metric and the connections are taken as independent quantities. The metric-affine theory of gravity has attracted considerable attention recently, since it was shown that within this framework some cosmological models, based on some generalized gravitational actions, can account for the current accelerated expansion of the universe. However we think that metric-affine gravity deserves much more attention than that related to cosmological applications and so we consider here metric-affine gravity theories in which the gravitational action is a general function of the scalar curvature while the matter action is allowed to depend also on the connection which is not {\textit{a priori}} symmetric. This general treatment will allow us to address several open issues such as: the relation between metric-affine { $f(R)$} gravity and General Relativity (in vacuum as well as in the presence of matter), the implications of the dependence (or independence) of the matter action on the connections, the origin and role of torsion and the viability of the minimal-coupling principle.},

  ABSTRACT = {For both {$f(R)$} theories of gravity with an independent symmetric connection (no torsion), usually referred to as Palatini {$f(R)$} gravity theories, and for {$f(R)$} theories of gravity with torsion but no non-metricity, called {$U_4$} theories, it has been shown that the independent connection can actually be eliminated algebraically, as long as this connection does not couple to matter. Remarkably, the outcome in both case is the same theory, which is dynamically equivalent with an {$\omega_0=-3/2$} Brans-Dicke theory. It is shown here that even for the most general case of an independent connection with both non-metricity and torsion one arrives at exactly the same theory as in the more restricted cases. This generalizes the previous results and explains why assuming that either the torsion or the the non-metricity vanishes ultimately leads to the same theory. It also demonstrates that {$f(R)$} actions cannot support an independent connection which carries dynamical degrees of freedom, irrespectively of how general this connection is, at least as long as there is no connection-matter coupling.},

  ABSTRACT = {The gauge gravitation theory, in spite of twenty five years of its history, still remainsthe single gap in the excellent gauge picture of fundamental interactions. The main disputable point is the gauge status of Einstein{'}s gravitational field, which is a metric or tetrad field, while gauge fields represent connections on fiber bundles. The corner-stones of Einstein{'}s gravitation theory are the Relativity and Equivalence Principles. Having been reformulated in the fiber bundle terms, the gravitation theory turns out to be built from these principles directly as a gauge theory of space-time symmetries, which, however, are spontaneously broken down to the Lorentz symmetries. Metric gravitational fields appear in such a theory as the consequence of this spontaneous symmetry breaking and have the nature of Goldstone type fields. The Lorentz, {$GL(4,\mathbb{R})$} and Poincaré gauge theories of gravitation are analyzed from these points of view, and some outlooks of the gauge treatment of gravitation, {\textit{e.g.} }, as the affine-metric theory, are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {In Einstein{'}s gravitational theory, the spacetime is Riemannian, that is, it has vanishing torsion and vanishing nonmetricity (covariant derivative of the metric). In the gauging of the general affine group {$A(4, \mathbb{R})$} and of its subgroup {$GL(4, \mathbb {R})$} in four dimensions, energy-momentum and hypermomentum currents of matter are canonically coupled to the coframe and to the connection of a metric-affine spacetime with nonvanishing torsion and nonmetricity, respectively. Fermionic matter can be described in this framework by half-integer representations of the $SL(4, \mathbb{R})$ covering subgroup. We set up a (first-order) Lagrangian formalism and build up the corresponding Noether machinery. For an arbitrary gauge Lagrangian, the three gauge field equations come out in a suggestive Yang-Mills like form. The conservation-type differential identities for energy-momentum and hypermomentum and the corresponding complexes and superpotentials are derived. Limiting cases such as the Einstein-Cartan theory are discussed. In particular we show, how the {$A(4,\mathbb{R})$} may \mkbibquote{break down} to the Poincar é (inhomogeneous Lorentz) group. In this context, we present explicit models for a symmetry breakdown in the cases of the Weyl (or homothetic) group, the {$SL(4, \mathbb{R})$ }, or the {$GL(4, \mathbb{R})$}.},

  ABSTRACT = {We give a short outline, in Sec. 2, of the historical development of the gauge idea as applied to internal ({$U(1)$ }, {$SU(2)$}, ...) and external ({$\mathbb{R}^4$ }, {$SO(1,3)$}, ...) symmetries and stress the fundamental importance of the corresponding conserved currents. In Sec. 3, experimental results with neutron interferometers in the gravitational field of the earth, as interpreted by means of the equivalence principle, can be predicted by means of the Dirac equation in an accelerated and rotating reference frame. Using the Dirac equation in such a non-inertial frame, we describe how in a gauge-theoretical approach (see Table 1) the Einstein-Cartan theory, residing in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime encompassing torsion and curvature, arises as the simplest gravitational theory. This is set in contrast to the Einsteinian approach yielding general relativity in a Riemannian spacetime. In Secs. 4 and 5 we consider the conserved energy-momentum current of matter and gauge the associated translation subgroup. The Einsteinian teleparallelism theory which emerges is shown to be equivalent, for spinless matter and for electromagnetism, to general relativity. Having successfully gauged the translations, it is straightforward to gauge the four-dimensional affine group {$\mathbb{R} ^4 \rtimes GL(4,\mathbb{ R })$} or its Poincar{ é} subgroup {$\mathbb{R}^4 \rtimes SO(1, 3)$ }. We briefly report on these results in Sec. 6 (metric-affine geometry) and in Sec. 7 (metric-affine field equations (111, 112, 113)). Finally, in Sec. 8, we collect some models, currently under discussion, which bring life into the metric-affine gauge framework developed.},

  ABSTRACT = {During the last five decades, gravity, as one of the fundamental forces of nature, has been formulated as a gauge field theory of the Weyl-Cartan-Yang-Mills type. The resulting theory, the Poincar{ é} gauge theory of gravity, encompasses Einstein{'}s gravitational theory as well as the teleparallel theory of gravity as subcases. In general, the spacetime structure is enriched by Cartan{'}s torsion and the new theory can accommodate fermionic matter and its spin in a perfectly natural way. The present reprint volume contains articles from the most prominent proponents of the theory and is supplemented by detailed commentaries of the editors. This guided tour starts from special relativity and leads, in its first part, to general relativity and its gauge type extensions a la Weyl and Cartan. Subsequent stopping points are the theories of Yang-Mills and Utiyama and, as a particular vantage point, the theory of Sciama and Kibble. Later, the Poincaré gauge theory and its generalizations are explored and specific topics, such as its Hamiltonian form and exact solutions, are studied. This guide to the literature on gauge theories of gravity is intended to be a stimulating introduction to the field of classical gauge theories of gravity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Some systems of fields have been considered which are invariant under a certain group of transformations depending on {$n$} parameters. A general rule is obtained for introducing a new field in a definite way with a definite type of interaction with the original fields by postulating the invariance of these systems under a wider group derived by replacing the parameters of the original group with a set of arbitrary functions. The transformation character of this new field under the wider group is determined from the invariance postulate. The possible types of the equations of the new fields can be also derived, giving rise to a certain conservation law owing to the invariance. As examples, the electromagnetic, the gravitational and the Yang-Mills fields are reconsidered following this line of approach.},

  ABSTRACT = {An argument leading from the Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian to the introduction of the gravitational field is presented. Utiyama{'}s discussion is extended by considering the 10‐parameter group of inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations, involving variation of the coordinates as well as the field variables. It is then unnecessary to introduce {\textit{a priori}} curvilinear coordinates or a Riemannian metric, and the new field variables introduced as a consequence of the argument include the vierbein components {$ \tensor{h}{_k^\mu}$} as well as the \mkbibquote { local affine connection} {$\tensor{A}{^i_{j\mu }}$}. The extended transformations for which the 10 parameters become arbitrary functions of position may be interpreted as general coordinate transformations and rotations of the vierbein system. The free Lagrangian for the new fields is shown to be a function of two covariant quantities analogous to {$F_{\mu\nu}$ } for the electromagnetic field, and the simplest possible form is just the usual curvature scalar density expressed in terms of {$\tensor{h}{ _k^\mu}$} and {$\tensor{A}{^i_{j \mu}}$}. This Lagrangian is of first order in the derivatives, and is the analog for the vierbein formalism of Palatini{'}s Lagrangian. In the absence of matter, it yields the familiar equations {$R_{\mu\nu}=0$} for empty space, but when matter is present there is a difference from the usual theory (first pointed out by Weyl) which arises from the fact that {$ \tensor{A}{^i_{j\mu}}$} appears in the matter field Lagrangian, so that the equation of motion relating {$\tensor{A}{^i_{j\mu}}$} to { $\tensor{h}{_k^\mu}$} is changed. In particular, this means that, although the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes, the affine connection {$\tensor{\Gamma}{^\lambda_{\mu\nu}} $} is nonsymmetric. The theory may be reexpressed in terms of the Christoffel connection, and in that case additional terms quadratic in the \mkbibquote{spin density} {$ \tensor{S}{^k_{ij}}$} appear in the Lagrangian. These terms are almost certainly too small to make any experimentally detectable difference to the predictions of the usual metric theory.},

  ABSTRACT = {We study a formulation of Dirac fermions in curved spacetime that respects general coordinate invariance as well as invariance under local spin-base transformations. The natural variables for this formulation are spacetime-dependent Dirac matrices subject to the Clifford-algebra constraint. In particular, a coframe, {\textit{ i.e.}} vierbein field is not required. The corresponding affine spin connection consists of a canonical part that is completely fixed in terms of the Dirac matrices and a free part that can be interpreted as spin torsion. A general variation of the Dirac matrices naturally induces a spinorial Lie derivative which coincides with the known Kosmann-Lie derivative in the absence of torsion. Using this formulation for building a field theory of quantized gravity and matter fields, we show that it suffices to quantize the metric and the matter fields. This observation is of particular relevance for field theory approaches to quantum gravity, as it can serve for a purely metric-based quantization scheme for gravity even in the presence of fermions.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article gives a geometric interpretation of the spin base formulation with local spin base invariance of spinors on a curved space-time and, in particular, of a central element, the global Dirac structure, in terms of principal and vector bundles and their endomorphisms. It is shown that this is intimately related to { $Spin$} and {$Spin^{ \mathbb{C}}$} structures in the sense that the existence of one of those implies the existence of a Dirac structure and allows for an extension to local spin base invariance. Vice versa, as a central result, the existence of a Dirac structure implies the existence of a { $Spin^{\mathbb{C}}$} structure. Nevertheless, the spin base invariant setting may be considered more general, allowing for more physical degrees of freedom. Furthermore, arguments are given that the Dirac structure is a more natural choice as a variable for (quantum) gravity than tetrads/vielbeins.},

  ABSTRACT = {We make a systematic study of the cosmological dynamics for a number of {$f(R)$} gravity theories in Palatini formalism. We find a number of interesting results: (i) models based on theories of the type (a) {$f(R)=R- \beta/R^n$} and (b) {$f(R)=R+\alpha \mathrm{ ln }(R)-\beta$ }, unlike the metric formalism, are capable of producing the sequence of radiation-dominated, matter-dominated and de-Sitter periods, and (ii) models based on theories of the type (c) {$f(R)=R+\alpha R^m -beta/R^n$} can produce early as well as late accelerating phases. However for the classes of models considered here, we have been unable to find the sequence of all four dynamical epochs required to account for the complete cosmological dynamics, even though three out of four phases are possible. We also place observational constraints on these models using the recently released supernovae data (SNLS) as well as the baryon acoustic oscillation peak and the CMB shift parameter. The best-fit values are found to be {$n=0.027$ }, {$\alpha =4.63$} for the models based on (a) and {$ \alpha=0.11$ }, {$\beta=4.62$} for the models based on (b), neither of which are significantly preferred over the {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The models based on (c) are also consistent with the data with suitable choices of their parameters. We also find that some of the models for which the radiation-dominated epoch is absent prior to the matter-dominated era also fit the data. The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the combination of the data considered here does not place stringent enough constraints on the cosmological evolution prior to the decoupling epoch, which highlights the importance of our combined theoretical-observational approach to constrain models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Extended Theories of Gravity can be considered as a new paradigm to cure shortcomings of General Relativity at infrared and ultraviolet scales. They are an approach that, by preserving the undoubtedly positive results of Einstein{'}s theory, is aimed to address conceptual and experimental problems recently emerged in astrophysics, cosmology and High Energy Physics. In particular, the goal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like inflation, dark energy, dark matter, large scale structure and, first of all, to give at least an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic principles that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical interpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the basic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the general framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are presented, focusing on specific classes of theories like {$f(R)$} -gravity and scalar–tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches. The special role of torsion is also discussed. The conceptual features of these theories are fully explored and attention is paid to the issues of dynamical and conformal equivalence between them considering also the initial value problem. A number of viability criteria are presented considering the post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian limits. In particular, we discuss the problems of neutrino oscillations and gravitational waves in extended gravity. Finally, future perspectives of extended gravity are considered with possibility to go beyond a trial and error approach.},

  ABSTRACT = {Classical generalization of general relativity is considered as gravitational alternative for unified description of the early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration. The structure and cosmological properties of number of modified theories, including traditional {$f(R)$} and Hoř ava-Lifshitz {$f(R)$} gravity, scalar-tensor theory, string-inspired and Gauss-Bonnet theory, non-local gravity, non-minimally coupled models, and power-counting renormalizable covariant gravity are discussed. Different representations and relations between such theories are investigated. It is shown that some versions of above theories may be consistent with local tests and may provide qualitatively reasonable unified description of inflation with dark energy epoch. The cosmological reconstruction of different modified gravities is made in great detail. It is demonstrated that eventually any given universe evolution may be reconstructed for the theories under consideration: the explicit reconstruction is applied to accelerating spatially-flat FRW universe. Special attention is paid to Lagrange multiplier constrained and conventional {$f(R)$} gravities, for last theory the effective {$\Lambda$}CDM era and phantom-divide crossing acceleration are obtained. The occurrence of Big Rip and other finite-time future singularities in modified gravity is reviewed as well as its curing via the addition of higher-derivative gravitational invariants.},

These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe.

  ABSTRACT = {One century after its formulation, Einstein{' }s general relativity (GR) has made remarkable predictions and turned out to be compatible with all experimental tests. Most of these tests probe the theory in the weak-field regime, and there are theoretical and experimental reasons to believe that GR should be modified when gravitational fields are strong and spacetime curvature is large. The best astrophysical laboratories to probe strong-field gravity are black holes and neutron stars, whether isolated or in binary systems. We review the motivations to consider extensions of GR. We present a (necessarily incomplete) catalog of modified theories of gravity for which strong-field predictions have been computed and contrasted to Einstein{'}s theory, and we summarize our current understanding of the structure and dynamics of compact objects in these theories. We discuss current bounds on modified gravity from binary pulsar and cosmological observations, and we highlight the potential of future gravitational wave measurements to inform us on the behavior of gravity in the strong-field regime.},

This situation leads researchers to look for \mkbibquote{the simplest modification} to general relativity, in a certain class of models, that is enough to solve one or more problems.

  ABSTRACT = {The advent of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a millimeter-wave very long baseline interferometric array, has enabled spatially resolved studies of the subhorizon-scale structure for a handful of supermassive black holes. Among these, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A{ $^\star$} (Sgr A{$^ \star$}), presents the largest angular cross section. Thus far, these studies have focused on measurements of the black hole spin and the validation of low-luminosity accretion models. However, a critical input in the analysis of EHT data is the structure of the black hole spacetime, and thus these observations provide the novel opportunity to test the applicability of the Kerr metric to astrophysical black holes. Here we present the first simulated images of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) around Sgr A{$^\star$} employing a quasi-Kerr metric that contains an independent quadrupole moment in addition to the mass and spin that fully characterize a black hole in general relativity. We show that these images can be significantly different from the images of an RIAF around a Kerr black hole with the same spin and demonstrate the feasibility of testing the no-hair theorem by constraining the quadrupolar deviation from the Kerr metric with existing EHT data. Equally important, we find that the disk inclination and spin orientation angles are robust to the inclusion of additional parameters, providing confidence in previous estimations assuming the Kerr metric based on EHT observations. However, at present, the limits on potential modifications of the Kerr metric remain weak.},

  ABSTRACT = {General relativity has passed all solar system experiments and neutron star based tests, such as binary pulsar observations, with flying colors. A more exotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or more black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the Universe, providing probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are motivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large deviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while recovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can probe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using electromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent ways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black hole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general relativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general relativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational degrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher curvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is four-dimensional. Altering a characteristic leads to a different extension of general relativity: (i) scalar–tensor theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity, and (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe black hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints on each theory using black hole based tests of gravity. We close this review by listing some of the open problems in model-independent tests and within each specific theory.},

  ABSTRACT = {Our Galactic Centre, Sagittarius A{$^\star$ }, is believed to harbour a supermassive black hole, as suggested by observations tracking individual orbiting stars. Upcoming submillimetre very-long baseline interferometry images of Sagittarius A{$^\star$} carried out by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration (EHTC) are expected to provide critical evidence for the existence of this supermassive black hole. We assess our present ability to use EHTC images to determine whether they correspond to a Kerr black hole as predicted by Einstein{'}s theory of general relativity or to a black hole in alternative theories of gravity. To this end, we perform general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations and use general-relativistic radiative-transfer calculations to generate synthetic shadow images of a magnetized accretion flow onto a Kerr black hole. In addition, we perform these simulations and calculations for a dilaton black hole, which we take as a representative solution of an alternative theory of gravity. Adopting the very-long baseline interferometry configuration from the 2017 EHTC campaign, we find that it could be extremely difficult to distinguish between black holes from different theories of gravity, thus highlighting that great caution is needed when interpreting black hole images as tests of general relativity.},

We show that the absence of such a deviation can be used to constrain the physics of extra dimensions of spacetime. Focusing on the Randall-Sundrum {$AdS_5$} brane-world scenario, we show that the observation of M87{ $^\star$}{'}s dark shadow sets the limit {$l \lesssim 170$} AU, where {$l$} is the {$AdS_5$} curvature radius. This limit is among the first quantitative constraints on exotic physics obtained from the extraordinary first ever image of the dark shadow of a black hole.},

  ABSTRACT = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of {$42 \pm 3 \mu$}as, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio {$ \gtrsim 10:1$}. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of {$M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_{ \odot}$}. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},

Nevertheless, long-standing open theoretical issues, as well as possible new observational ones arising from the explosive development of cosmology the last two decades, offer the motivation and lead a large amount of research to be devoted in constructing various extensions and modifications. All extended theories and scenarios are first examined under the light of theoretical consistency, and then are applied to various geometrical backgrounds, such as the cosmological and the spherical symmetric ones. Their predictions at both the background and perturbation levels, and concerning cosmology at early, intermediate and late times, are then confronted with the huge amount of observational data that astrophysics and cosmology are able to offer recently. Theories, scenarios and models that successfully and efficiently pass the above steps are classified as viable and are candidates for the description of Nature. We list the recent developments in the fields of gravity and cosmology, presenting the state of the art, high-lighting the open problems, and outlining the directions of future research. Its realization is performed in the framework of the COST European Action \mkbibquote{ Cosmology and Astrophysics Network for Theoretical Advances and Training Actions}.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work, we investigate the effects of the torsion–fermionic interaction on the energy levels of fermions within a Riemann–Cartan geometry using a model-independent approach. We consider the case of fermions minimally coupled to the background torsion as well as non-minimal extensions via additional couplings with the vector and axial fermionic currents which include parity-breaking interactions. In the limit of zero-curvature, and for the cases of constant and spherically symmetric torsion, we find a Zeeman-like effect on the energy levels of fermions and anti-fermions depending on whether they are aligned/anti-aligned with respect to the axial vector part of the torsion (or to specific combination of torsion quantities), and determine the corresponding fine-structure energy transitions. We also discuss non-minimal couplings between fermionic fields and torsion within the Einstein–Cartan theory and its extension to include the (parity-breaking) Holst term. Finally we elaborate on the detection of torsion effects related to the splitting of energy levels in astrophysics, cosmology and solid state physics using current capabilities.},

  ABSTRACT = {The geometrical nature of gravity emerges from the universality dictated by the equivalence principle. In the usual formulation of General Relativity, the geometrisation of the gravitational interaction is performed in terms of the spacetime curvature, which is now the standard interpretation of gravity. However, this is not the only possibility. In these notes we discuss two alternative, though equivalent, formulations of General Relativity in flat spacetimes, in which gravity is fully ascribed either to torsion or to non-metricity, thus putting forward the existence of three seemingly unrelated representations of the same underlying theory. Based on these three alternative formulations of General Relativity, we then discuss some extensions.},

  ABSTRACT = {We discuss equivalent representations of gravity in the framework of metric-affine geometries pointing out basic concepts from where these theories stem out. In particular, we take into account tetrads and spin connection to describe the so called \textit{ Geometric Trinity of Gravity}. Specifically, we consider General Relativity, constructed upon the metric tensor and based on the curvature { $ R $ }; Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, formulated in terms of torsion {$ T $} and relying on tetrads and spin connection; Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, built up on non-metricity {$ Q $}, constructed from metric tensor and affine connection. General Relativity is formulated as a geometric theory of gravity based on metric, whereas teleparallel approaches configure as gauge theories, where gauge choices permit not only to simplify calculations, but also to give deep insight into the basic concepts of gravitational field. In particular, we point out how foundation principles of General Relativity (i.e. the Equivalence Principle and the General Covariance) can be seen from the teleparallel point of view. These theories are dynamically equivalent and this feature can be demonstrated under three different standards: (1) the variational method; (2) the field equations; (3) the solutions. Regarding the second point, we provide a procedure starting from the (generalised) second Bianchi identity and then deriving the field equations. Referring to the third point, we compare spherically symmetric solutions in vacuum recovering the Schwarzschild metric and the Birkhoff theorem in all the approaches. It is worth stressing that, in extending the approaches to {$ f(R) $}, {$ f(T) $}, and {$ f(Q) $} gravities respectively, the dynamical equivalence is lost opening the discussion on the different number of degrees of freedom intervening in the various representations of gravitational theories.},

  ABSTRACT = {We discuss two aspects of {$f(R)$} theories of gravity in metric formalism. We first study the reasons to introduce a scalar-tensor representation for these theories and the behavior of this representation in the limit to General Relativity, {$f(R) \rightarrow R$}. We find that the scalar-tensor representation is well behaved even in this limit. Then we work out the exact equations for spherically symmetric sources using the original { $f(R)$} representation, solve the linearized equations, and compare our results with recent calculations of the literature. We observe that the linearized solutions are strongly affected by the cosmic evolution, which makes very unlikely that the cosmic speedup be due to { $f(R)$} models with correcting terms relevant at low curvatures.},

  ABSTRACT = {The exterior Cauchy problem is discussed for the fourth-‐order theories of gravity derived from the Lagrangian densities {$ \mathcal{L}= \sqrt{-g}\left(R+(a/2)R^2+bR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} \right )- \kappa \mathcal{L}_m$}. When {$b\neq 0$ }, the Cauchy problem can be solved by the standard method already used in general relativity. When {$b=0$ }, the problem cannot be formulated as in the case where {$b\neq 0$ }, since the corresponding fourth‐-order theory is shown to be equivalent to a second‐‐order scalar–‐tensor theory. This scalar–‐tensor theory is proved to coincide with one of the models of gravity proposed by O'Hanlon in order to present a covariant version of the massive dilaton theory suggested by Fujii. This result is generalized: The models of O'Hanlon are shown to be indistinguishable from the fourth-‐order theories derived from the Lagrangian densities {$\mathcal{L}=\sqrt{-g} f(R)-\kappa\mathcal{L} _m$ }, where {$f$} is any real function such that {$f''(R)$} does not identically vanish.},

A prescription is given to convert a non-invariant canonical (\mkbibquote{pseudo}) energy-momentum tensor into an invariant one. The symmetric part of these field equations is examined for the two cases: (1) under linear and non-relativistic approximation, it reduces to the classical gravitational-field equation, (2) for static and spherically symmetric field, its solution is shown to correspond to Schwarzschild{'}s solution. The antisymmetric part has no classical analogues, for there are no sources of skew-symmetric energy-momentum tensors in the classical experiments.

  ABSTRACT = {We study perturbative quantum gravity in the first-order tetrad formalism. The lowest order action corresponds to Einstein-Cartan plus a parity-odd term, and is known in the literature as the Holst action. The coupling constant of the parity-odd term can be identified with the Immirzi parameter {$\gamma$} of loop quantum gravity. We compute the quantum effective action in the one-loop expansion. As in the metric second-order formulation, we find that in the case of pure gravity the theory is on-shell finite, and the running of Newton{'}s constant and the Immirzi parameter is inessential. In the presence of fermions, the situation changes in two fundamental aspects. First, non-renormalizable logarithmic divergences appear, as usual. Second, the Immirzi parameter becomes a priori observable, and we find that it is renormalized by a four-fermion interaction generated by radiative corrections. We compute its beta function and discuss possible implications. The sign of the beta function depends on whether the Immirzi parameter is larger or smaller than one in absolute value, and {$\gamma^2=1$} is a UV fixed-point (we work in Euclidean signature). Finally, we find that the Holst action is stable with respect to radiative corrections in the case of minimal coupling, up to higher order non-renormalizable interactions.},

  ABSTRACT = {We set up a nonperturbative gravitational coarse graining flow and the corresponding functional renormalization group equation on the as to yet unexplored \mkbibquote{tetrad only} theory space. It comprises action functionals which depend on the tetrad field (along with the related background and ghost fields) and are invariant under the semi-direct product of spacetime diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations. This theory space differs from that of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) in that the tetrad rather than the metric constitutes the fundamental variable and because of the additional symmetry requirement of local Lorentz invariance. It also differs from \mkbibquote{Quantum Einstein Cartan Gravity} (QECG) investigated recently since the spin connection is not an independent field variable now. We explicitly compute the renormalization group flow on this theory space within the tetrad version of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. A detailed comparison with analog results in QEG and QECG is performed in order to assess the impact the choice of a fundamental field variable has on the renormalization behavior of the gravitational average action, and the possibility of an asymptotically safe infinite cutoff limit is investigated. Implications for nonperturbative studies of fermionic matter coupled to quantum gravity are also discussed. It turns out that, in the context of functional flow equations, the \mkbibquote{hybrid calculations} proposed in the literature (using the tetrad for fermionic diagrams only, and the metric in all others) are unlikely to be quantitatively reliable. Moreover we find that, unlike in perturbation theory, the non-propagating Faddeev-Popov ghosts related to the local Lorentz transformations may not be discarded but rather contribute quite significantly to the beta functions of Newton{' }s constant and the cosmological constant.},

In the second part we apply it to a specific three-dimensional truncated theory space which is parametrized by Newton{'} s constant, the cosmological constant, and the Immirzi parameter. A comprehensive analysis of their scale dependences is performed, and the possibility of defining an asymptotically safe theory on this hitherto unexplored theory space is investigated. In principle Asymptotic Safety of metric gravity (at least at the level of the effective average action) is neither necessary nor sufficient for Asymptotic Safety on the Einstein-Cartan theory space which might accommodate different \mkbibquote{universality classes of microscopic quantum gravity theories }. Nevertheless, we do find evidence for the existence of at least one non-Gaussian renormalization group fixed point which seems suitable for the Asymptotic Safety construction in a setting where the spin connection and the vielbein are the fundamental field variables.},

  ABSTRACT = {We construct a special-purpose functional flow equation which facilitates non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) studies on theory spaces involving a large number of independent field components that are prohibitively complicated using standard methods. Its main motivation are quantum gravity theories in which the gravitational degrees of freedom are carried by a complex system of tensor fields, a prime example being Einstein–Cartan theory, possibly coupled to matter. We describe a sequence of approximation steps leading from the functional RG equation of the Effective Average Action to the new flow equation which, as a consequence, is no longer fully exact on the untruncated theory space. However, it is by far more \mkbibquote{user friendly} when it comes to projecting the abstract equation on a concrete (truncated) theory space and computing explicit beta-functions. The necessary amount of (tensor) algebra reduces drastically, and the usually very hard problem of diagonalizing the pertinent Hessian operator is sidestepped completely. In this paper we demonstrate the reliability of the simplified equation by applying it to a truncation of the Einstein–Cartan theory space. It is parametrized by a scale dependent Holst action, depending on a {$O(4)$} spin-connection and the tetrad as the independent field variables. We compute the resulting RG flow, focusing in particular on the running of the Immirzi parameter, and compare it to the results of an earlier computation where the exact equation had been applied to the same truncation. We find consistency between the two approaches and provide further evidence for the conjectured non-perturbative renormalizability (asymptotic safety) of quantum Einstein–Cartan gravity. We also investigate a duality symmetry relating small and large values of the Immirzi parameter ({$\gamma \rightarrow 1/ \gamma$}) which is displayed by the beta-functions in the absence of a cosmological constant.},

A detailed comparison with Quantum Einstein-Cartan Gravity (QECG), Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG), and \mkbibquote{ tetrad-only} gravity, all based on different theory spaces, is performed. It is demonstrated that, over a generic theory space, the construction of a functional RG equation (FRGE) for the effective average action requires the specification of a metric on the infinite-dimensional field manifold as an additional input. A modified FRGE is obtained if this metric is scale-dependent, as it happens in the metric-torsion system considered.},

  ABSTRACT = {{\textit{If gravity is a metric field by Einstein, it is a Higgs field.}} Gravitation theory meets spontaneous symmetry breaking in accordance with the Equivalence Principle reformulated in the spirit of Klein-Chern geometries of invariants. In gravitation theory, the structure group of the principal linear frame bundle { $ LX $} over a world manifold {$ X^4 $} is reducible to the connected Lorentz group {$ SO(3,1) $}. The physical underlying reason of this reduction is Dirac fermion matter possessing only exact Lorentz symmetries. The associated Higgs field is a tetrad gravitational field {$ h $} represented by a global section of the quotient {$ \Sigma $ } of {$ LX $} by {$ SO(3,1) $}. The feature of gravity as a Higgs field issues from the fact that, in the presence of different tetrad fields, Dirac fermion fields are described by spinor bundles associated with different reduced Lorentz subbundles of {$ LX $}, and we have nonequivalent representations of cotangent vectors to {$ X^4 $} by Dirac{'}s matrices. It follows that a fermion field must be regarded only in a pair with a certain tetrad field. These pairs fail to be represented by sections of any product bundle {$ S \times \Sigma $}, but sections of the composite spinor bundle {$ S \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow X^4 $}. They constitute the so-called fermion-gravitation complex where values of tetrad gravitational fields play the role of coordinate parameters, besides the familiar world coordinates. In Part 1 of the article, geometry of the fermion-gravitation complex is investigated. The goal is the total Dirac operator into which components of a connection on {$ S \rightarrow \Sigma $} along tetrad coordinate directions make contribution. The Part II will be devoted to dynamics of fermion-gravitation complex. It is a constraint system to describe which we use the covariant multisymplectic generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism when canonical momenta correspond to derivatives of fields with respect to all world coordinates, not only the time.},

Furthermore, they have provided operative procedures for testing the validity of general relativity, or constraining competing theories of gravitation. This has led to a flourishing of different, and inequivalent, formulations of these principles, with the undesired consequence that often the same name, \textquote{equivalence principle}, is associated with statements having a quite different physical meaning. In this paper we provide a precise formulation of the several incarnations of the equivalence principle, clarifying their uses and reciprocal relations.

@online{borde1994,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper clarifies some aspects of Lorentzian topology change, and it extends to a wider class of spacetimes previous results of Geroch and Tipler that show that topology change is only to be had at a price. The scenarios studied here are ones in which an initial spacelike surface is joined by a connected \mkbibquote{ interpolating spacetime} to a final spacelike surface, possibly of different topology. The interpolating spacetime is required to obey a condition called causal compactness, a condition satisfied in a very wide range of situations. No assumption is made about the dimension of spacetime. First, it is stressed that topology change is kinematically possible; i.e., if a field equation is not imposed, it is possible to construct topology-changing spacetimes with non-singular Lorentz metrics. Simple 2-dimensional examples of this are shown. Next, it is shown that there are problems in such spacetimes: Geroch's closed-universe argument is applied to causally compact spacetimes to show that even in this wider class of spacetimes there are causality violations associated with topology change. It follows from this result that there will be causality violations if the initial (or the final) surface is not connected, even when there is no topology change. Further, it is shown that in dimensions {$\geq 3$} causally compact topology-changing spacetimes cannot satisfy Einstein's equation (with a reasonable source); i.e., there are severe dynamical obstructions to topology change. This result extends a previous one due to Tipler. Like Tipler's result, it makes no assumptions about geodesic completeness; i.e., it does not permit topology change even at the price of singularities (of the standard incomplete-geodesic variety). Brief discussions are also given of ways in which the results of this paper might be circumvented.},

  ABSTRACT = {A change of spatial topology in a causal, compact spacetime cannot occur when the metric is globally Lorentzian. One can however construct a causal metric from a Riemannian metric and a Morse function on the background cobordism manifold, which is Lorentzian almost everywhere except that it is degenerate at each critical point of the function. We investigate causal structure in the neighbourhood of such a degeneracy, when the auxiliary Riemannian metric is taken to be Cartesian flat in appropriate coordinates. For these geometries, we verify Borde and Sorkin's conjecture that causal discontinuity occurs if and only if the Morse index is 1 or {${n-1}$}.},

  ABSTRACT = {Topology change is considered to be a necessary feature of quantum gravity by some authors, and impossible by others. One of the main arguments against it is that spacetimes with changing spatial topology have bad causal properties. Borde and Sorkin proposed a way to avoid this dilemma by considering topology changing spacetimes constructed from Morse functions, where the metric is allowed to vanish at isolated points. They conjectured that these Morse spacetimes are causally continuous (hence quite well behaved), as long as the index of the Morse points is different from 1 and {$n-1$}. In this paper, we prove a special case of this conjecture. We also argue, heuristically, that the original conjecture is actually false, and formulate a refined version of it.},

  ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work is threefold: first it should be a monographical work on natural bundles and natural operators in differential geometry. This is a field which every differential geometer has met several times, but which is not treated in detail in one place. Let us explain a little, what we mean by naturality. Exterior derivative commutes with the pullback of differential forms. In the background of this statement are the following general concepts. The vector bundle $\bigwedge ^k (T^* M)$ is in fact the value of a functor, which associates a bundle over $M$ to each manifold $M$ and a vector bundle homomorphism over $f$ to each local diffeomorphism $f$ between manifolds of the same dimension. This is a simple example of the concept of a natural bundle. The fact that exterior derivative $d$ transforms sections of $\bigwedge ^k (T^* M)$ into sections of $\bigwedge^{k+1} (T^* M)$ for every manifold $M$ can be expressed by saying that $d$ is an operator from $\bigwedge^{k} (T^* M)$ into $\bigwedge^{k+1} (T^* M)$.},

  ABSTRACT = {The local geometrical structure of general relativity is analyzed in detail from the standpoint of a formulation of gravity as a gauge theory of the de Sitter group {$SO(3,2)$} . In order to reproduce the structure of the Einstein-Cartan theory, it is essential that the {$SO(3,2)$} gauge symmetry be spontaneously broken down to the Lorentz group. In the geometrical analysis of this spontaneously broken theory, the Goldstone field of the symmetry-breaking mechanism plays a central role, representing the coordinates of a point in an internal anti-de Sitter space where the motions induced by parallel transport across space-time take place. In order to establish the connection between the {$SO(3,2)$} gauge theory and the Einstein-Cartan theory, the gravitational vierbein and spin connection are derived from the original {$SO(3, 2)$} gauge fields by passing over to a set of nonlinearly-transforming fields through a redefinition involving the Goldstone field. The original {$SO(3,2)$} gauge fields have a different but equally important role: they generate pseudotranslations and rotations in the internal anti-de Sitter space under a kind of parallel transport across space-time that is called \mkbibquote{development}. Development maps curves in space-time into image curves in the internal space, and vector fields along the curves in space-time into image vector fields along the image curves. Considering development along infinitesimal closed curves in space-time leads to the proper interpretation of the effects of torsion and of curvature in terms of the nonclosure of image curves and of the rotation of image vectors with respect to their original values.},

In preparation for an explicit symmetry breaking scenario, we consider nonlinear realizations of the group of analytical diffeomorphisms which provide a unified description of spacetime structures. We find that gravitational fields, such as the affine connection, metric and coordinates, can all be interpreted as Goldstone fields of the diffeomorphism group. We then construct a Higgs mechanism for gravity in which an affine spacetime evolves into a Riemannian one by the condensation of a metric. The symmetry breaking potential is identical to that of hybrid inflation but with the non-inflaton scalar extended to a symmetric second rank tensor. This tensor is required for the realization of the metric as a Higgs field. We finally comment on the role of Goldstone coordinates as a dynamical fluid of reference.},

  ABSTRACT = {Gravitational gauge theories with de Sitter, Poincaré and affine symmetry group are investigated under the aspect of the breakdown of the initial symmetry group down to the Lorentz subgroup. As opposed to the nonlinear realization approach, in the dynamical symmetry breaking procedure, the structure subgroup is not chosen arbitrarily, but is dictated by the symmetry of the groundstate of a Higgs field. We review the theory of spontaneously broken de Sitter gravity by Stelle and West and apply a similar approach to the case of the Poincaré and affine groups. We will find that the Poincaré case is almost trivial. The translational Higgs field reveals itself as pure gauge, i.e., it is expressed entirely in terms of the Nambu–Goldstone bosons and does not appear in the Lagrangian after the symmetry breaking. The same holds for the translational part of the affine group. The Higgs field provoking the breakdown of the general linear group leads to the determination of the Lorentzian signature of the metric in the groundstate. We show that the Higgs field remains in its groundstate, i.e., that the metric will have Lorentzian signature, unless we introduce matter fields that explicitely couple to the symmetric part of the connection. Furthermore, we present arguments that the Lorentzian signature is actually the only possible choice for physical spacetime, since the symmetry breaking mechanism works only if the stability subgroup is taken to be the Lorentz group. The other four-dimensional rotation groups are therefore ruled out not only on physical, but also on theoretical grounds. Finally, we show that some features, like the necessity of the introduction of a dilaton field, that seem artificial in the context of the affine theory, appear most natural if the gauge group is taken to be the special linear group in five dimensions. We also present an alternative model which is based on the spinor representation of the Lorentz group and is especially adopted to the description of spinor fields in a general linear covariant way, without the use of the infinite dimensional representations which are usually considered to be unavoidable.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article is a review of modern approaches to gravity that treat the gravitational interaction as a type of gauge theory. The purpose of the article is twofold. First, it is written in a colloquial style and is intended to be a pedagogical introduction to the gauge approach to gravity. I begin with a review of the Einstein-Cartan formulation of gravity, move on to the Macdowell-Mansouri approach, then show how gravity can be viewed as the symmetry broken phase of an (A)dS-gauge theory. This covers roughly the first half of the article. Armed with these tools, the remainder of the article is geared toward new insights and new lines of research that can be gained by viewing gravity from this perspective. Drawing from familiar concepts from the symmetry broken gauge theories of the standard model, we show how the topological structure of the gauge group allows for an infinite class of new solutions to the Einstein-Cartan field equations that can be thought of as degenerate ground states of the theory. We argue that quantum mechanical tunneling allows for transitions between the degenerate vacua. Generalizing the tunneling process from a topological phase of the gauge theory to an arbitrary geometry leads to a modern reformulation of the Hartle-Hawking \mkbibquote {no boundary} proposal.},

It is shown that, if the theory is asymptotically free and a dynamical mass is generated, then an effective geometry may be induced and a gravity theory emerges. The asymptotic freedom and the running of the mass might account for an Inönü–Wigner contraction which induces a breaking of the gauge group to the Lorentz group, while the mass itself is responsible for the coset sector of the gauge field to be identified with the effective vierbein. Furthermore, the resulting local isometries are Lorentzian for the anti de Sitter group and Euclidean for the de Sitter and orthogonal groups.},

  ABSTRACT = {A completely metric-free {$SL(5,\mathbb{R})$} gauge framework is developed in four dimensions. After spontaneous symmetry breaking of the corresponding topological {$BF$} scheme, Einstein spaces with a tiny cosmological constant emerge, similarly as in (anti-)de Sitter gauge theories of gravity. The induced { $\Lambda$} is related to the scale of the symmetry breaking. A \mkbibquote{ background} metric surfaces from a Higgs-like mechanism. The finiteness of such a topological scheme converts into asymptotic safeness after quantization of the spontaneously broken model.},

  ABSTRACT = {From pure Yang–Mills action for the SL(5,R) group in four Euclidean dimensions we obtain a gravity theory in the first order formalism. Besides the Einstein–Hilbert term, the effective gravity has a cosmological constant term, a curvature squared term, a torsion squared term and a matter sector. To obtain such geometrodynamical theory, asymptotic freedom and the Gribov parameter (soft BRST symmetry breaking) are crucial. Particularly, Newton and cosmological constant are related to these parameters and they also run as functions of the energy scale. One-loop computations are performed and the results are interpreted.},

@thesis{sadovski2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Our main go in this thesis is to test the large-scale consistency of a quatnum gravity model. This model consists of a Yang-Mills theory with gauge group {$SO(m,n)$} written in a four-dimensional euclidean space-time. In the infrared limit, the {$SO(m,n)$} algebra undergoes an Inönü-Wigner contraction to Poincaré algebra and the gauge symmetry is broken. As consequence, Lorentz local symmetries arise and the gauge fields can be identified with a vierbein field, {$e(x)$}, and a spin connection field, {$\omega (x)$}. The resulting gravity is an effective Einstein-Cartan-like theory with ultraviolet correction terms and propagating torsion field. An advantage of this model is the natural appearance of a gravitational cosmological constant that, along with Newton{'}s gravitational constant, {$G$}, can be calculated perturbatively. Making use of the FLRW metric and the ansatz of a riemannian spacetime we demonstrate that this effective gravity has the Standard Cosmological Model in its infrared sector. Furthermore, the ultraviolet regime forsee a hyper-accelerated de Sitter phase that may prove to be inflationary and also foresee the presence of exotic matter in the early universe.},

If {$det(e_0)=0$} one must take into account configurations with non-zero torsion. The analogy is discussed with the first-order formulation for gauge theories and the connection-dependent counter-terms for the spinor theory.},

  ABSTRACT = {Generalised geometry studies structures on a d-dimensional manifold with a metric and 2-form gauge field on which there is a natural action of the group SO(d,d). This is generalised to d-dimensional manifolds with a metric and 3-form gauge field on which there is a natural action of the group Ed. This provides a framework for the discussion of M-theory solutions with flux. A different generalisation is to d-dimensional manifolds with a metric, 2-form gauge field and a set of p-forms for p either odd or even on which there is a natural action of the group Ed+1. This is useful for type IIA or IIB string solutions with flux. Further generalisations give extended tangent bundles and extended spin bundles relevant for non-geometric backgrounds. Special structures that arise for supersymmetric backgrounds are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {We give a systematic account of unconstrained free bosonic higher-spin fields on D-dimensional Minkowski and (Anti-)de Sitter spaces in the frame formalism. The generalized spin connections are determined by solving a chain of torsion-like constraints. Via a generalization of the vielbein postulate these allow to determine higher-spin Christoffel symbols, whose relation to the de Wit-Freedman connections is discussed. We prove that the generalized Einstein equations, despite being of higher-derivative order, give rise to the AdS Frønsdal equations in the compensator formulation. To this end we derive Damour-Deser identities for arbitrary spin on AdS. Finally we discuss the possibility of a geometrical and local action principle, which is manifestly invariant under unconstrained higher-spin symmetries.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we establish and clarify the link between the recently found E7 generalised geometric structures, which are based on the SU(8) invariant reformulation of D=11 supergravity proposed long ago, and newer results obtained in the framework of recent approaches to generalised geometry, where E7 duality is built in and manifest from the outset. In making this connection, the so-called generalised vielbein postulate plays a key role. We explicitly show how this postulate can be used to define an E7 valued affine connection and an associated covariant derivative, which yields a generalised curvature tensor for the E7 based exceptional geometry. The analysis of the generalised vielbein postulate also provides a natural explanation for the emergence of the embedding tensor from higher dimensions},

  ABSTRACT = {Extending previous work on generalised geometry, we explicitly construct an E7-valued vielbein in eleven dimensions that encompasses the scalar bosonic degrees of freedom of D=11 supergravity, by identifying new \mkbibquote{ generalised vielbeine } in eleven dimensions associated with the dual 6-form potential and the dual graviton. By maintaining full on-shell equivalence with the original theory at every step, our construction altogether avoids the constraints usually encountered in other approaches to generalised geometry and, as a side product, also furnishes the non-linear ansatz for the dual (magnetic) 7-form flux for any non-trivial compactification of D=11 supergravity, complementing the known non-linear ansaetze for the metric and the 4-form flux. A preliminary analysis of the generalised vielbein postulate for the new vielbein components reveals tantalising hints of new structures beyond D=11 supergravity and ordinary space-time covariance, and also points to the possible D=11 origins of the embedding tensor. We discuss the extension of these results to E8.},
