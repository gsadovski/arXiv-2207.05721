## Addressing the comments

Before we begin, we would like to thank the referee for agreeing to this review process and for the time dedicated to improve this manuscript.

In regard to the first comment made, our results are valid for all spacetime dimensions and all metric-affine dynamics (up to arbitrarily high but finite high-derivative terms). The validity within the scope of the trinity of gravity is implicitly stated as the trio is a particular subset of all metric-affine dynamics. This phrase has been repeated throughout the manuscript, thus we chose not to add another comment. Nevertheless, we did add the reference suggested by the referee.

About the second comment made, it is hard to say at a first glance if the geometric version of the equivalence principle is related to the Noether symmetry version the equivalence principle, pointed out by the referee. The geometric version has a topological framing while the Noether has a dynamical one. It is possible that one underpins the other, but further investigation is needed. To highlight the general issue surrounding the equivalence principle, we did add a comment in Section 2.

## List of changes

The following comment was added as the footnote 6, in Section 2.2: 

> Unfortunately, the equivalence principle is vaguely defined throughout history and literature. There are many (often inequivalent) ways to state it physically and/or mathematically [13, 65-68]. In this work, we adopt the so-called "geometric" version because it is the one naturally related to the issue at hand --- *vide* Section 5.3. Additionally, this version is physically and mathematically unambiguous as it builds upon the gauge principle, the Chern-Weil theory and the Erlangen program.
